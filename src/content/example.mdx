- Uses fenced code block with correct backticks and language
- Contains only standard Markdown and basic JSX-compatible MDX

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes That Cause This Error

| Problem | Fix |
|--------|-----|
| Using `{{ }}` for interpolation like in Vue or Liquid | ❌ Not valid in MDX |
| Unclosed tags like `<div>` | ✅ Must be proper JSX |
| Extra indents before frontmatter (`---`) | ✅ Start at the top with no spaces |
| Mixing JS inside Markdown (e.g., `if () {}`) | ✅ Wrap logic in components if needed |

---

## ✅ If You Want JSX Inside

You can do this **only if the JSX is valid:**

```mdx
<div className="custom-block">
  <p>This is a valid JSX element inside MDX.</p>
</div>
