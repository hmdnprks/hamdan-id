# Using Shiki with rehype-pretty-code

One of the best ways to render code in your blog is by using `rehype-pretty-code`, which wraps Shiki and gives you access to VS Code themes, line highlighting, word highlights, and more.

Let's say you want to render a TypeScript function:

```ts {title=greet.ts highlight=2}
export const greet = (name: string) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}`;
};
```
