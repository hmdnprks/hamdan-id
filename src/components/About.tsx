      <p className="text-base text-muted leading-relaxed">
        I&apos;m a Software Engineer based in Jakarta, working at Telkomsel.
        I love turning ideas into digital experiences â€” from building scalable web apps
        to exploring the artistic side of photography and videography.
        Whether it&apos;s engineering clean code or capturing cinematic streets, I enjoy the balance between logic and creativity.
